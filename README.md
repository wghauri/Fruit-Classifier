# Fruit Classifier

This project is designed to predict and identify a fruit based on the camera frames.
For training the model, the images were transformed in various ways and were put
through convolution networks. The data used for this model is from the [Fruit-Image-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishandandekar/fruitimagedataset),
containing around 90,000 images of 131 fruits and vegetables.
